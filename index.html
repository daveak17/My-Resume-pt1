    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a determined and goal-driven aspiring web developer, deeply committed to learning and 
        growing within the field of web technologies. 
        I stay engaged with the latest developments, approach challenges with consistency and adaptability, 
        and bring a structured mindset to my work. 
        With strong organizational habits, a collaborative spirit, and a natural curiosity, 
        I’m building a solid foundation for a career that blends creativity, 
        problem-solving, and technology.
    </p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        Currently at the beginning of my journey into web development, I have learned the fundamentals of HTML 
        and am actively expanding my skills across the front-end spectrum. 
        My objective is to gain hands-on experience in real-world projects where I can contribute, 
        continue learning, and grow into a confident and capable developer. 
        I am seeking an opportunity such as an internship, entry-level role, 
        or mentorship that values passion, potential, and a willingness to learn.
